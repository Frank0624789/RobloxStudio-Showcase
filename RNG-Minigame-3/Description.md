## Overview
A mini random title rolling game. There are different titles that can be rolled with a press of the roll button: common, rare (1/4), cool (1/16), legend (1/64), legend AWAKENED (1/4 if legend was rolled), god (1/1000).

There is a luck button for added ease of obtaining the titles legend and beyond.

## What was used
GUIs. This was minigame heavily revolved around the GUIs and their relation to each other.

Module Scripts were used for the first time and used to implement the luck system across scripts.

The math behind rolling titles was a bit difficult to envision at first.
