# RobloxStudio-Showcase


Hi, I’m Frank — a high school student learning Roblox game development with a focus on scripting and systems.

This repository contains small Roblox Studio prototypes I’ve built to explore game mechanics and problem-solving code.

(Any models used are NOT mine)
(All animations were made by me)

The Folders are numbered oldest to newest (1->n)

Each folder includes:
- A short video demo (if the mp4 fails there is a link in "Description")
- A brief explanation of what the prototype demonstrates titled "Description"
