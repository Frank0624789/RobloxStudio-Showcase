# RobloxStudio-Showcase


Hi, I’m Frank — a high school student learning Roblox game development with a focus on scripting and systems.

This repository contains small Roblox Studio prototypes I’ve built to explore game mechanics and problem-solving code.

Each folder includes:
- A short video demo
- A brief explanation of what the prototype demonstrates titled "Description"
