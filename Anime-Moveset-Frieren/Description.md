# Anime Moveset Frieren
## Overview
The unfinished personal project PvP game I started over the summer. The intent was for a new style of PvP game where everyone had the same kit and attacks were ranged. As such, there would be more reliance on movement and disabling the opponent's movement in order to create an attack opening.

## My Notes
This was a project I attempted to take on all by myself. Although that burden pushed my efforts down, I walked away from the experience with broadened knowledge on particles, creating/working with them, and scripting them.
