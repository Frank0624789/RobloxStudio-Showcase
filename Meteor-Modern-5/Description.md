# Meteor Modern
## Overview
A small project of a meteor summon ability. Utilizes the skills developed in other mini projects. 

The player holds E to activate the AOE circle where the meteor is projected to land. The player can keep the E key held and move around to adjust the positioning of the meteor's target drop area. Once the player releases the E key, The meteor is summoned into the sky and drops onto the target area, damaging any enemies in it.

This project also contains a leaderboard for number of uses of the meteor ability. This value is updated and saved.

## What was used
The meteor is an embodiment of the skills I had learned prior with the only new way of scripting that needed learning being the use of UserInputService to detect holding keys.

The leaderboard was something I needed to learn and decided to add in along with the use of DataStore I had learned as well in order to preserve count of the number of meteor uses the player had.
