# Anime Moveset Gojo

## Overview
A simple set of abilities inspired by the anime character Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen.

The first ability displayed is "Lapse Blue" which, upon activation, deals pulls nearby enemies (within 40 studs) into it and deals damage. Activated with the click of the E key.

The second is "Red". This ability fires off a small red orb at a target dealing damage. Activated with the click of the R key.

The third is "Hollow Purple (blast)". This ability fires off a blast that travels in a linearly based on the player's orientation dealing damage to any enemy it hits along the way. Activated with the click of the P key.

The last is "Hollow Purple MAXIMUM". This is an ability interaction. It requires the player to first use "Lapse Blue" and then before the blue orb disappears, the player must fire a "Red" towards the blue orb— hitting it. Upon contact, the "Red" and "Lapse Blue" disappear and are replaced with a new purple explosion dealing extra damage to enemies as well as the player. Use of this interraction puts the "Red" ability on cooldown for 3 seconds.

## My Notes
The "Hollow Purple (blast)" was made in 2022. That was when I was hesitant to use TweenService and instead used BodyVelocity.

The "Lapse Blue" was made in 2023. I was still hesitant to use TweenService so this "pull effect" was done using Lerp.

## What was used

"Lapse Blue" was made using Lerp.

"Red" was my first use of TweenService

"Hollow Purple MAXIMUM" used a lot of hit detection

"Hollow Purple (blast)" used BodyVelocity.
