# Anime-Moveset-Gojo

# Overview
A simple set of abilities inspired by the anime character Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen.

The first ability displayed is "Lapse Blue" which, upon activation, deals pulls nearby enemies (within 40 studs) into it and deals damage. Activated with the click of the E key.

The second is "Red". This ability fires off a small red orb at a target dealing damage. Activated with the click of the R key.

The third is "Hollow Purple (blast)". This ability fires off a blast that travels in a linearly based on the player's orientation dealing damage to any enemy it hits along the way. Activated with the click of the P key.

The last is "Hollow Purple MAXIMUM". This is an ability interaction. It requires the player to first use "Lapse Blue" and then before the blue orb disappears, the player must fire a "Red" towards the blue orb— hitting it. Upon contact, the "Red" and "Lapse Blue" disappear and are replaced with a new purple explosion dealing extra damage to enemies as well as the player. Use of this interraction puts the "Red" ability on cooldown for 3 seconds.
